Welcome to my first python project.

This is a real-time translator that allowed you speek one language and would tranlate to text also split the sentense(Speech to Text). Then program would show another language by tranlating also read the sentense(T). And, save the mp3 file on your assigned path.

#### Available language:

Examples: (e.g. en, ja, ko, pt, zh, zh-TW, ...)


#### Noted encoding problems that could cause garbled text.

This project is uploaded by Pycharm including script and library.
